# SysStat Setup #

The CANDE light detector needs the ``sar`` command line tool and the ``sadc``
shared library from sysstat.

## Instructions ##

1. build sysstat-android with ``android_build.sh``, requires correct
   environment setup as the Android NDK is used (see ``envgen.sh``)
2. build an Android system image with SAR and CANDE, see ``cande`` folder
