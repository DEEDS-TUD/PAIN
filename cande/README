NOTES:
  the sar parser is written to accept only decimal point representation, hence
  it is necessary to set the system locale to support decimal point instead of
  comma. (e.g. en_US)

1. build cande_heavy_detector and cande_light_detector with ``make android``
2. build the sar tool and library, see folder ``sar-android``
2. build an Android system image containing CANDE (including sar, heavy and
   light detector) with ``gen-system-imgage.sh`` (see ``scripts``)
3. run the emulator using the custom system image
